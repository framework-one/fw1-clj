Contributing to Framework One (FW/1 for Clojure)
==
Please note that in order to encourage more people to get involved with Framework One, we have adopted a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that _everyone_ should feel welcome and safe when getting involved with any aspect of the Framework One community.

All development happens in the main [Framework One for Clojure repository](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1-clj) on the **master** branch. Feel free to fork the repo and submit Pull Requests on the **master** branch. You can also open issues there to discuss potential enhancements etc.

Pull Requests that contain new/updated tests for the bug fix / enhancement will be looked on more favorably than those that do not contain fixes. I intend to set up Travis-CI soon, to automatically run the test suite for Pull Requests which helps us be confident that the Pull Request is "good".

You can run tests locally with `boot test`.

Please follow the same formatting as the existing code, especially in terms of indentation and layout of parentheses. If in doubt, ask on the mailing list.

By submitting a Pull Request, you are granting copyright license to Sean Corfield and that your submission may be legally released under the Apache Source License 2.0 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

The **master** branch represents the current release of FW/1 for Clojure. In due course there will be a **develop** branch and the contribution policy will change.
