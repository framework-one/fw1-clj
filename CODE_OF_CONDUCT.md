# Framework One Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of FW/1 or any Framework One asset, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in Framework One a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

Framework One maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Framework One maintainers who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the Framework One or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be immediately reported on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/framework-one) or by contacting Sean Corfield via [email](mailto:sean@corfield.org) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/seancorfield).

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http:contributor-covenant.org), version 1.0.0, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/0/0/](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/0/0/)
